# cuda-projects
A collection of independent CUDA programs exploring GPU computing, parallel processing, and performance optimization using NVIDIA's CUDA framework.

2D reduction.ipynb provides different implementations of reducing a 2D array to a 1D array such that each element in the 1D array is the sum of all the elements in a single row of the matrix. Explores different optimizations such as memory coalescing, tree-reductions, warp-level reductions and compares the execution time and other metrics.
